# Build

This project was made in c++ with cmake, so you will need g++ and cmake

You can build the project on linux like so:
```
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
Or you can use the script "build_linux.sh" to build the project.

After that, you can find the binary in the "build" folder
